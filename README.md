# UFO-sightings---data-dramatization

This group project was prepared as an assignment for an academic course of interactive programming in Processing language. 
The aim was to analyze and dramatize the dataset provided. Our dataset summarised information about UFO sightings in several countries. 
The program is written in Processing 4, using processing sound library Processing Sound.

**Analysis of the data:**
We decided to take into account only the sightings that took place in the USA. To make the data more visible, we decided to display only three ship shapes that were reported - triangle, circle and disk.
We removed data points that corresponded to non-continental USA. The dates of the sightings were sorted and the data was extracted from 1990 to 1999.

**Graphic user interface:**
A graphic user interface was prepared to enable easier navigation through the data. The four buttons that are displayed have different functions. 
The user can choose either to watch an animation showing the UFO sightings during a ten-year period (1990-1999) or use a slider to go through the sightings each year. There are also Exit and Home buttons. 
A soundtrack was added to make the interaction more entertaining. 

**Data display:**
After clicking the Years button, the user sees a map of the USA and a slider below it. Changing the position of the slider enables the user to see which sightings happened during which year. 
If the mouse is over one of the points, a text box appears that displays more detailed information about the given sighting. 
After clicking the Play button, the user can see an animation that displays the occurrence of the sightings with the passing of the years. 

Below you can watch a video demonstrating the data dramatization.
